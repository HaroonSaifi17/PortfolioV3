## Introduction 

We all wanted to a good job in big tech companies and we think company wants a good employee. But, the reality is there main concern is get maximum profit by using some unusual ways. I am not saying all company do that but a quite large portion of company do this things. In this blog i want to discuss what are this things how to prevent yourself from that.

## What are the things company do to get maximum profits 
1. **Unpaid Internship**: This is the most common way to get maximum profit. They hire a intern and give them a task which is not related to there work. They do this because they don't want to pay for that work.
2. **Closing a job position**: They fake a job position and take interview of many candidates and then they close that position. They do this because they want to know what other companies are doing and what are the new technologies are coming. In come senarios government regulates them to hire fresher but they don't want to do that resulting faking the job opening.
3. **Hackathon**: They organize hackathon and take the idea from there and implement that in there product. They do this because they don't want to pay for that idea. Some of the great examples for that are Amazon, Flipkart, etc.
4. **Freelancer**: They hire a freelancer and give them a task and so they don't need hire a full time employee. They do this because freelancer are cheap, they don't require a employee benifits such as health care, equity etc. 

## How to prevent yourself from That 
- **Research**: Before joining a company do a research about that company. Check there reviews on glassdoor, indeed etc. Check there employee reviews on LinkedIn. Check there product reviews on playstore, appstore etc.

- **Ask**: Ask the interviewer about the company culture, work life balance, salary etc. If they are not giving you a proper answer then it's a red flag.
