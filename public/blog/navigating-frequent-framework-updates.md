## Introduction

Frontend frameworks are essential in modern web development, offering structure and efficiency. However, the rapid pace of updates can introduce challenges that often go unaddressed.

## The Challenges

1. **Learning Curve**: Each new feature demands time to master, slowing down development.
2. **Compatibility**: Updates may break existing code, causing unexpected issues.
3. **Maintenance**: Constant updates require ongoing adjustments, increasing workload.
4. **Community Support**: Frequent changes can leave developers without reliable guidance.

## Angular Signals Example

Angular Signals, a recent addition, offer a reactive approach to state management. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```typescript
import { signal } from '@angular/core';

// Create a signal
const counter = signal(0);

// Update the signal's value
counter.set(counter() + 1);

// React to changes
counter.subscribe(value => console.log(`Counter updated: ${value}`));
```

This illustrates how new features, while powerful, require developers to adapt quickly.
