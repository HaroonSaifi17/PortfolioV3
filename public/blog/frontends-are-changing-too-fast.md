## Introduction

When you think, you become you become quite decent in a framework, and then the next version comes out, and you have to start all over again. This is the reality for many developers working with frontend frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue. We all goes through this.

Recently, I have been exploring the new changes in [Angular 18](https://angular.dev/) and found that it introduces many new features, which are great for better development. However, learning and keeping up to date has been a real challenge for me.

I am an experienced developer and have been working with Angular for 3 years now. I started with Angular 14, which used a module-based structure. Now, it has completely changed and has become standalone with the new Signal API, which alters the flow of coding. While it's great that everything is backward compatible, digesting all the new features and maintaining a decently sized project has become quite a hassle.

## The Challenges

1. **Learning Curve**: Each new feature demands time to master, slowing down development.
2. **Compatibility**: Updates may break existing code, causing unexpected issues.
3. **Maintenance**: Constant updates require ongoing adjustments, increasing workload.
4. **Community Support**: Frequent changes can leave developers without reliable guidance.

## Introduction of new rendering patterns in recent framework updates

New rendering patten's, look like great but changes the flow of how to write frontend.

**Rendering Pattern's**: It refers to the way in which the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code is all processed and rendered in a web application or website. Ex: SSR(Server side rendering), SSG(Prerendering) and more.

In Angular 18 they provide SSR/Prerendering support, but it have a big learning curve. Many of the globle browser objects like window, navigater etc, don't works in SSR so you need to check platform every time you used any of these objects, and don't even try think about DOM manipulation. That's all the thing i tackle when trying only new feature in Angular 18.

## It's the problem for all framework's

It's not just Angular that faces this issue. React, Vue, and other frameworks also introduce frequent updates, each with its own learning curve. While these updates are essential for progress, they can be overwhelming for developers.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, navigating frequent framework updates is a challenge that developers face across the board. While these updates bring new features and improvements, they also demand time and effort to master. As developers, we must find a balance between staying up to date and maintaining our projects effectively. By sharing knowledge and resources, we can overcome these challenges and continue to grow as developers.
