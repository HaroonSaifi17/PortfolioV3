    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a full-stack developer who learned to code by building projects and
      solving problems. I've explored various related fields, including DevOps,
      Android, and open source. I'm also a Linux enthusiast who uses Arch (by
      the way) and manages my dotfiles to perfection.
